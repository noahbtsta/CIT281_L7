# Lab 7

In this lab I created my own Github organization for the CIT Minor. This included creating a new repository, 
cloning repository, creating Javascript folders, and pushing changes to  Github. This organization 
folder will be useful for me because I will have all my projects and labs in one place for my current
and future CIT classes. 

### Skills Used in Project
- Creating repository
- Cloning repo
- Initialzing Node.js folder
- CLI commands for git
- Navigating through the Github interface 
- Creating .gitignore
